### Phases of Energy Audit

* Pre- Audit Phase: The pre-audit phase has to be structured and methodical.  Additionally, an initial study of the site helps in better understanding and for efficient working. This phase deals with creating an audit team, identification of areas that consume the most energy, identify the instrumentation required for the audit and preparing a time frame.
* Audit Phase: The audit phase includes a detailed analysis of various departments/ process equipment over periods of time to understand the energy consumption. Audit includes analysis over both working hours and non-working hours.
* Post Audit Phase: This phase deals with the implementation of the audit recommendations and follow-up.
