description : "In your industrial infrastructure project, we typically start the project by collecting all information regarding your electrical load. We estimate how much electrical energy is required for your industrial infrastructure project. We then determine the type of input voltage (MV or LV) to use on a routine basis for your electrical installation to ensure cost efficiency and proper operation of all equipment in your plant. These constitute a thorough analysis of your electrical load data to enable us formulate the best design for your system."

### Electrical Load

An electrical load is referred to as the component of a circuit that consumes power. In electrical design, the first step in an industrial project is to list out all the electrical load required in that facility in a load list, from which a load schedule is formulated.

### Components of a typical load list

* Equipment
* Number of machines
* Power requirement
* Type of usage: continuous, emergency, intermittent, etc
* Power factor
* Diversity factor
* Rated load per machine

As professional industrial electrical engineering designers, we analyze the data and subsequently decide the load requirement, installed load, load factor, diversity factor, steady-state demand, maximum demand, connected load etc, culminating in a decision on the type of power required.  In doing this, we check the data along with the local codes, tariff policies and required energy sources.

### Key Deliverables

* Load Calculation
* Load Factor Calculations
* Diversity Factor Calculations
* Maximum Demand Calculation
* Installed and Contract Load Calculation
* Electrical Installation Sizing
* Transformer Sizing
* Block Diagrams
* Block Estimates
* Primary Consultation Report

Load data analysis culminates in properly sizes electrical power distribution and control systems, both at the infeed of the industrial development, all the way downstream to every load. This also determines the size and specification of power transformer and back-up power equipment required for the industrial development.
