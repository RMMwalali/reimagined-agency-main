At *i*PAS, we specialize in the design of substations in various configurations with both air-insulated and/or gas-insulated switchgear, all considering your system's requirements and available space, up to 220kV. Beyond this, we ensure designs and their implementation are according to local safety

and regulatory standards, considering the critical function played by electrical substations.

### Key Components of Our Documentation Design
