description : "Electrical power and signals need reliable and properly sized and designed conduction paths for transmission from their source to the designated load centres/ signal receptors. It’s for this reason that proper design and sizing of electrical power and signaling conductors is a fundamental part of any electrical design process. Failure to do this, stability and reliability of the resulting system are critical matters that have to be foregone from the onset."

At *i*PAS, we put every single factor in consideration during the
sizing and design of not only your electrical power and signal conductors, but
also the cable management system. Electrical conductors basically come in two
forms: cables or busways. As reliable experts, we will guide you towards the
right choice to ensure maintenance of the highest quality of your installation's
electrical power and also energy efficiency of your installation. In doing
this, we will also be in cognizant of all the ambient conditions of your installation, to ensure that the ultimate electrical conduction system in your
installation withstands the test of time and is sufficient for your present and future need for scalability.

### Key Design Process Deliverables

* Conductor sizing calculation.
* Cable schedules.
* Layout – Cable ladder, cable tray and cable duct sizing.
* Busbar sizing and layout.
* Equipment termination lists.
* Cable cutting schedules.
* Material take-off lists.
