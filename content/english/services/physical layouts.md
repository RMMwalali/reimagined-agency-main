At *i*PAS, we harmonize with all the design teams for your plant
i.e the civil team, mechanical team, process team and all the rest, to realize
perfect synchrony of the electrical layout with respect to the process and
equipment at hand. A properly designed electrical power distribution layout not
only gives clear guidance to the installation contractors, but also gives a
clear picture of installations to be done at a future date.

### Key Design Phase Deliverables

* Electrical equipment layout for the incoming MV supply to your plant.
* Electrical equipment layout for the LV distribution equipment.
* Layouts for PCC and MCC rooms.
* Layouts for power, control and instrumentation cables reticulation within the plant.
