# meta description
description : "This entails the organization of the electrical power distribution system topology from the infeed electrical power sources to every electrical energy utilization point. By creating this, we provide a road map for designing the electrical works. Our design process for this entails preparation of the installation structure for two or more levels of the system. Design of this architecture is done considering the installations required of the project. A well-prepared architecture provides information on the types of power sources available and defines system parameters at each distribution and utilization level."

### Impacts of Distribution Architecture on an Installation

![power distribution architecture on an installation](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtnbwgpca/image/upload/v1704004434/fbjg5vh0us1lbddgpk1s.jpg)

The architecture impacts the overall electrical installation; as such it has to be properly designed.

Load data analysis culminates in properly sizes electrical power distribution and control systems, both at the infeed of the industrial development, all the way downstream to every load. This also determines the size and specification of power transformer and back-up power equipment required for the industrial development

### Key aspects of the project impacted by the architecture

* Timeline of construction: A properly drawn
  distribution system optimizes the timeline.
* Performance: It impacts the performance during
  operations especially the quality of supply, power losses etc.
* The
  end-of-life recycling for the electrical installation

### Grouping of loads

Voltage drop calculations, harmonic distortion and power factor are
criteria to group loads together. As a result, the distribution equipment like
power control centres, motor control centres, distribution boards, auxiliary
systems, power back up systems, power quality improvement systems etc are
worked out based on the grouping. We use the latest technical tools and software
programmes for the generation of distribution design, distribution architecture
modelling and detailed drawing development. The ultimate
aim is high power
quality and system performance throughout the whole installation.
